# UFOs
# Overview of the Analysis 
The project is purposely to update a webpage created earlier on for Dana. The webpages are to both display a table that contains information about UFO sightings.
The 2 deliverables to be completed include;
  1. Updated Version 2.0 of webpage which filters UFO sightings on multiple criteria.
  2. Awritten report(README.md)
# Results
With the 2.0 version which is newer compared to the 1.0, the user has more flexibility when it comes to exploring the data provided.
# Summary.
A drawback to the current webpage is the lack of an export functionality. This makes it harder to record results for later use unless recorded manually. This might be a hard task to perform for starters compared to those who are more familiar with the process of recording manually
